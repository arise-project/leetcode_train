#Big(O) notation.

The notation fuction f is Big(O) for a multiole functions g when f is eventyally bounded by multiple of g.

##Algebra of Big(O)

Thre are five rules for simplify g function to produce Big(O) f function:

* Constants are neglible.
* Two sequential g functions in Big(O) f function will be sum.
* If every step of g1 requeres g2 steps then in Big(O) f function will be multiplication of g1 and g2.
* For polinomial g function Big(O) f function elliminate all members except domain.
* Big(O) function for larger terms dominate in sums.

When you know algorithm Big(O) function then you can compare implementations performance and also grade it to excelent, good, fair, bad and horrible.
